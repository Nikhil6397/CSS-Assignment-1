    <h1>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>

    <ul>
        <li class="ul color">
            Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1
        </li>
        <li class="ul color">
            Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section
        </li>
        <li class="ul color">
            External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file
        </li>
        <li class="ul color">
            The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however, <span
                class="span2 b1">in
                this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate,and
            easier for you to
            try it yourself
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="color b2">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple
        elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a
        special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</h3>

    <p class="color p5">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once
        an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>

    <p class="color p6">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.
        Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
